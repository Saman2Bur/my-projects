# Netflix EDA (1990s)

This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the `netflix_data.csv` dataset to understand more about movies from the 1990s.

## Project Tasks
1. **Most frequent movie duration**  
   - Determine the most common duration (in minutes) for movies released between 1990â€“1999.  
   - Save the result as an integer variable called `duration`.

2. **Short action movies**  
   - A movie is considered *short* if it is less than 90 minutes long.  
   - Count the number of short **Action** movies released in the 1990s.  
   - Save this count as an integer variable called `short_movie_count`.
