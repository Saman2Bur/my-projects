# My Projects

A collection of projects I built to practice and improve my coding skills in **data analysis** and **data science**.

## Projects
1. [Netflix EDA](01-netflix-eda/README.md)
   - Exploratory Data Analysis on Netflix movies from the 1990s  
   - Found the most common movie duration  
   - Counted short action movies (< 90 minutes)

2. [NYC SAT Analysis](02-nyc-sat/README.md)
   - Analyzed SAT results of NYC schools  
   - Found schools with best math results (â‰¥ 80% of 800)  
   - Identified the top 10 schools by total SAT scores  
   - Determined which borough has the largest standard deviation in SAT results  

*(More projects will be added here as I complete them.)*
